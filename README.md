# langtools

Repository of language data sources and structures for developing language learning games.


## Best practices and standards

- Language codes should be used at the level of [ISO_639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) to account for dialects, e.g. 'spa' for Castillian Spanish.
- Genders are coded according to [ISO/IEC_5218](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_5218), i.e. 0=unknown, 1=male, 2=female, 9=na.


## To do / decide

- Add tags to verb lists to indicate if their form is regular/irregular.
- Restructure verb conjugations from lists to dictionaries? What is most compatible between different languages or most useful for tools/games?
- How to structure nouns (dictionaries, classes?)
