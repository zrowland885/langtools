# langtools

## Best practices

Language codes should be used at the level of [ISO_639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) to account for dialects, e.g. 'spa' for Castillian Spanish.

## To do / decide

- Add tags to verb lists to indicate if their form is regular/irregular.
- Restructure verb conjugations from lists to dictionaries? What is most compatible between different languages or most useful for tools/games?
- Structure nouns as dictionaries or classes?

## Datasources

- [OmegaWiki](http://www.omegawiki.org/Help:Downloading_the_data) language dictionaries available freely under CC-0 license.
